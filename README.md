# Greenness_FI
Frailty is a late-life clinical syndrome resulting from the accumulation of aging-induced decline in physiological processes, function, and reserve in multiple organs or systems, leading to vulnerability and death. There is evidence that greenspaces measured with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are protective of frailty. However, NDVI is not as informative as greenness structure indices in describing greenspacesâ€™ constitution, shape, and connectivity, which can be measured by the largest patch index (LPI), shape index, and cohesion index. Higher values of the LPI, shape, and cohesion mean larger, more complex, and more dense greenspaces. We aim to study the association between greenness structures and frailty in a Chinese elderly cohort.
